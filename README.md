# DNA-to-Amino-Acids

You are able to take DNA code and translate it into Amino acids. I also went ahead and had them grouped based off stop codons
so that you are able to see the whole peptide.

Note that you will need to have the DNA seqence total divisible by 3 or it wont work. You also need it to be a straight line there
cant be any other chacters(including blank spaces).
